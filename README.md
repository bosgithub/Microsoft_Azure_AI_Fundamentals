## Get started with AI on Azure
### How does machine learning work?
Data scientists can use data gathered to train machine learning models that can make predictions and inferences based on the relationships they find in the data.



### Machine learning in Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure provides the Azure Machine Learning service - a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models. 

Azure Machine Learning provides the following features and capabilities:

MACHINE LEARNING IN MICROSOFT AZURE

Automated machine learning: This feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.

Azure Machine Learning designer:	A graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.

Data and compute management:	Cloud-based data storage and compute resources that professional data scientists can use to run data experiment code at scale.

Pipelines: Data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations professionals can define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks.


### Anomaly detection

a machine learning based technique that analyzes data over time and identifies unusual changes.



### Anomaly detection in Microsoft Azure

In Microsoft Azure, the Anomaly Detector service provides an application programming interface (API) that developers can use to create anomaly detection solutions.

### Computer vision
Computer vision is machine learning models which process visual inputs such as picture and videos. This is used for image classification, object detection,
semantic segmentation, image analysis/description, facial detection analysis, OCR and more. Microsoft Azure offers services such as computer vision, custom vision, face, form recognizer.
