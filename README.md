## Get started with AI on Azure
### How does machine learning work?
Data scientists can use data gathered to train machine learning models that can make predictions and inferences based on the relationships they find in the data.



### Machine learning in Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure provides the Azure Machine Learning service - a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models. 

Azure Machine Learning provides the following features and capabilities:

MACHINE LEARNING IN MICROSOFT AZURE

Automated machine learning: This feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.

Azure Machine Learning designer:	A graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.

Data and compute management:	Cloud-based data storage and compute resources that professional data scientists can use to run data experiment code at scale.

Pipelines: Data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations professionals can define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks.


### Anomaly detection

a machine learning based technique that analyzes data over time and identifies unusual changes.



### Anomaly detection in Microsoft Azure

In Microsoft Azure, the Anomaly Detector service provides an application programming interface (API) that developers can use to create anomaly detection solutions.

### Computer vision
Computer vision is machine learning models which process visual inputs such as picture and videos. This is used for image classification, object 

detection, semantic segmentation, image analysis/description, facial detection analysis, OCR and more. 

Microsoft Azure offers services such as:

Computer vision: analyze images and video, and extract descriptions, tags, objects, and text

Custom vision: train custom image classification and object detection models using your own images

Face: build face detection and facial recognition solutions

Form recognizer: extract information from scanned forms and invoices


### Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is the area of AI that deals with creating software that understands written and spoken language.

NLP enables you to create software that can:

Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources.

Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses.

Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages.

Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.

#### Natural language processing in Microsoft Azure

In Microsoft Azure, we have:

1. Text Analytics: Use this service to analyze text documents and extract key phrases, detect entities(places, dates, and people), and evaluate

sentiment(positive, negative)

2. Translator text: Use this service to translate text between more than 60 languages

3. Speech: Used to recognize and synthesize speech, and to translate spoken languages

4. Language Understanding Intelligent Service(LUIS): Train language model that can understand spoken or text-based commands

### Conversational AI

Conversational AI is used to describe solutions where AI agent participate in conversation with humans

Bots can be the basis of AI solutions for:

Customer support for products or services

Reservation systems for restaurants, airlines, cinemas, and other appointment based businesses

Health care consultations and self-diagnosis

Home automation and personal digital assistants

#### Conversational AI in Microsoft Azure

QnA: this cognitive service enables you to quickly build a *knowledege base* of questions and answers that can form the basis of a dialog between a hunman and an AI agent

Azure Bot Service: This service provides a platform for creating, publishing, and managing bots. Developers can use the Bot Framework to create a bot and manage it with Azure Bot Service - integrating back-end services like QnA Maker and LUIS, and connecting to channels for web chat, email, Microsoft Teams, and others
