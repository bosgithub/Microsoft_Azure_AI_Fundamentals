# Microsoft_Azure_AI_Fundamentals

### How does machine learning work?

Data scientists can use data gathered to train machine learning models that can make predictions and inferences based on the relationships they find in the data.

### Machine learning in Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure provides the Azure Machine Learning service - a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models. 

Azure Machine Learning provides the following features and capabilities:

MACHINE LEARNING IN MICROSOFT AZURE

Automated machine learning: This feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.

Azure Machine Learning designer:	A graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.

Data and compute management:	Cloud-based data storage and compute resources that professional data scientists can use to run data experiment code at scale.

Pipelines: Data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations professionals can define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks.


### Anomaly detection

a machine learning based technique that analyzes data over time and identifies unusual changes.

### Anomaly detection in Microsoft Azure

In Microsoft Azure, the Anomaly Detector service provides an application programming interface (API) that developers can use to create anomaly detection solutions.

### Computer vision

Computer vision is machine learning models which process visual inputs such as picture and videos. This is used for image classification, object 

detection, semantic segmentation, image analysis/description, facial detection analysis, OCR and more. 

Microsoft Azure offers services such as:

Computer vision: analyze images and video, and extract descriptions, tags, objects, and text

Custom vision: train custom image classification and object detection models using your own images

Face: build face detection and facial recognition solutions

Form recognizer: extract information from scanned forms and invoices


### Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is the area of AI that deals with creating software that understands written and spoken language.

NLP enables you to create software that can:

Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources.

Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses.

Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages.

Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.

#### Natural language processing in Microsoft Azure

In Microsoft Azure, we have:

1. Text Analytics: Use this service to analyze text documents and extract key phrases, detect entities(places, dates, and people), and evaluate

sentiment(positive, negative)

2. Translator text: Use this service to translate text between more than 60 languages

3. Speech: Used to recognize and synthesize speech, and to translate spoken languages

4. Language Understanding Intelligent Service(LUIS): Train language model that can understand spoken or text-based commands

### Conversational AI

Conversational AI is used to describe solutions where AI agent participate in conversation with humans

Bots can be the basis of AI solutions for:

Customer support for products or services

Reservation systems for restaurants, airlines, cinemas, and other appointment based businesses

Health care consultations and self-diagnosis

Home automation and personal digital assistants

#### Conversational AI in Microsoft Azure

QnA: this cognitive service enables you to quickly build a *knowledege base* of questions and answers that can form the basis of a dialog between a hunman and an AI agent

Azure Bot Service: This service provides a platform for creating, publishing, and managing bots. Developers can use the Bot Framework to create a bot and manage it with Azure Bot Service - integrating back-end services like QnA Maker and LUIS, and connecting to channels for web chat, email, Microsoft Teams, and others

#### Responsible AI

#### 6 principles of building responsible AI from microsoft

1. Fairness

AI systems should treat all people fairly.

Azure Machine Learning includes the capability to interpret models and quantify the extent to which each feature of the data influences the model's prediction. This capability helps data scientists and developers identify and mitigate bias in the model.

2. Reliability and safety

AI systems should perform reliably and safely. 

AI-based software application development must be subjected to rigorous testing and deployment management processes to ensure that they work as expected before release.

3. Privacy and security

AI systems should be secure and respect privacy. The machine learning models on which AI systems are based rely on large volumes of data, which may contain personal details that must be kept private. Even after the models are trained and the system is in production, it uses new data to make predictions or take action that may be subject to privacy or security concerns.

4. Inclusiveness

AI systems should empower everyone and engage people. AI should bring benefits to all parts of society, regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or other factors.

5. Transparency

AI systems should be understandable. Users should be made fully aware of the purpose of the system, how it works, and what limitations may be expected.

6. Accountability

People should be accountable for AI systems. Designers and developers of AI-based solution should work within a framework of governance and organizational principles that ensure the solution meets ethical and legal standards that are clearly defined.

## Azure Fundamentals part 1: Describe core Azure concepts

Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals. 

## What is cloud computing? 

It's the delivery of computing services over the internet, which is otherwise known as the cloud. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, all of which can be scaled.

## Azure services

Compute, Networking, Storage, Mobile, Databases, Web, Internet of Things (IoT), Big data, AI, DevOps

## What is Azure?

Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help your organization meet your current and future business challenges. Azure gives you the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

### What is the Azure portal?

The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. With the Azure portal, you can manage your Azure subscription by using a graphical user interface. 

1. Build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments.

2. Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources.

3. Configure accessibility options for an optimal experience.


### What is Azure Marketplace?
Azure Marketplace helps connect users with Microsoft partners, independent software vendors, and startups that are offering their solutions and services, which are optimized to run on Azure. Azure Marketplace customers can find, try, purchase, and provision applications and services from hundreds of leading service providers. All solutions and services are certified to run on Azure

The solution catalog spans several industry categories such as open-source container platforms, virtual machine images, databases, application build and deployment software, developer tools, threat detection, and blockchain. Using Azure Marketplace, you can provision end-to-end solutions quickly and reliably, hosted in your own Azure environment. At the time of writing, there are more than 8,000 listings.

Azure Marketplace is designed for IT pros and cloud developers interested in commercial and IT software. Microsoft partners also use it as a launch point for all joint go-to-market activitie
